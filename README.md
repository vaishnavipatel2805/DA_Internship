<h3>Dataset 2: Cancer Patients Dataset</h3>

<p>This dataset contains medical, lifestyle, environmental, and treatment-related information of cancer patients from multiple countries between 2014 and 2024. It is designed for healthcare analytics, risk factor study, survival analysis, cost evaluation, and machine learning model development.

The dataset can help uncover patterns in cancer occurrence, factors influencing severity, treatment behavior, and survival outcomes.
Ideal for EDA, visualization projects, healthcare research, and predictive modeling.

| Column Name               | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Country_Region**        | Country/region of the patient or treatment location.                         |
| **Year**                  | Year of diagnosis/treatment record. Useful for trend analysis.               |
| **Genetic_Risk**          | Score indicating hereditary risk of cancer. Higher = greater predisposition. |
| **Air_Pollution**         | Environmental pollution exposure level in the region.                        |
| **Alcohol_Use**           | Alcohol consumption score of the patient/region.                             |
| **Smoking**               | Smoking exposure index or habit level.                                       |
| **Obesity_Level**         | Body obesity/BMI indicator contributing to cancer risk.                      |
| **Cancer_Type**           | Type of cancer diagnosed (Lung, Breast, Colon, etc.).                        |
| **Cancer_Stage**          | Stage of cancer at diagnosis (Stage 0 - Stage IV).                           |
