### Bivariate Analysis Insights:-

1. Numerical–Numerical Analysis

    a. Age vs. Fare
    
        There is no strong linear correlation between Age and Fare.
        Very high fares are typically paid by adults in 1st class, not by children.
        Children (Age < 10) usually have moderate to low fares, indicating family travel in lower classes.
    
    b.Age vs. Individual Fare
    
        No strong relationship with age itself.
        Younger children sometimes show 0 or very small individual fare.
    
2. Numerical–Categorical Analysis

    a. Survived vs. Age
    
        Survival is higher among children (especially < 10 years).
        Younger female passengers survive the most.
        Middle-aged men (30–50) show the lowest survival.
    
    b. Survived vs. Fare
    
        Higher-fare passengers have a much higher survival rate.
        Low-fare passengers (mostly 3rd class) have poor survival.
        high fare higher priority during evacuation.
    
    c. Survived vs. Individual Fare
    
        High individual fare → High survival
        Low individual fare → Low survival

3. Categorical–Categorical Analysis

    a. Survived vs. Pclass
    
        1st class → highest survival
        2nd class → moderate
        3rd class → lowest (especially adult males)
    
    Class is one of the strongest survival predictors.
    
    b. Survived vs. Sex
    
        Females have very high survival due to the "women and children first" rule.
        Males, especially in 3rd class, have poor survival outcomes.
    
    c. Survived vs. Title

        Titles like Miss, Mrs, Master show higher survival.
        Title Mr has the lowest survival.
        Rare aristocratic titles show almost guaranteed survival, reflecting privilege.

    d. Survived vs Sex

        Females had significantly higher survival compared to males.
        The “women and children first” rule strongly influenced outcomes.
        Male passengers, especially from 3rd class, had the lowest survival rate.
        Sex was one of the strongest predictors of survival in the Titanic dataset.

    e. Survived vs Embarked
    
        Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) had the highest survival rate
        Southampton (S) passengers had the lowest survival.
        Queenstown (Q) had moderate to low survival, but the sample size is small.
