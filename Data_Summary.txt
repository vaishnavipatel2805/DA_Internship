### Description of dataset:-

The Titanic dataset offers a comprehensive glimpse into the passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, which famously sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. This dataset contains a wealth of information about individual passengers, including demographics, ticket class, cabin information, family relationships, fare details, and most notably, survival outcomes.

1. test.csv ->  Contains passenger details without the Survived column.
418 entries, 11 columns

2. train.csv -> Contains passenger details along with the Survived column (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive).
891 entries , 12 columns


### Columns Explained:-

1. PassengerID: Unique ID assigned to each passenger
2. Survived: (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)
3. Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) 1st = Upper Class / Wealthier2 , 2nd = Middle Class, 3rd = Lower Class / Steerage
4. Name: Passenger’s full name
5. Sex: Passenger’s gender
6. Age: Passenger’s age
7. SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
8. Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
9. Ticket: Ticket number
10. Fare: Ticket fare price
11. Cabin: Cabin assignment
12. Embarked: Port of embarkation i.e., initial place of borading (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Column Types:-

Numerical - Age,Fare,PassengerId, fair
Categorical - Survived, Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch,Embarked
Mixed - Name, Ticket, Cabin

### Issues in datasets:-

-> Manual Inspection findings:-

1. name : (object) 
    
    lastName, title. firstName (other name)
    a. some has middle name while others don't
    b. some has other name
    c. some names contain "
    d. Miss./Ms.
    e. titles like don. , col., Rev. present

2. age : (numeric)
    a. some ages are in floats
    b. Null values present - 

3. ticket : (mixed)
    a. mixed data, both integer and text
    b. varying numbers in ticket num

4. price : (numeric)
    a. passenger_id 1264 , 180, 303, 414, 467, 482, 598, 634, 675, 823, 816 has 0 as price 
    b. above passengers 180, 303, 598 has LINE as entry in ticket col

5. cabin : (categorical)
    lot of missing values

-> programming inspection :-

Train.csv : 891 entries , 12 columns

1. passenger_id : (string)
    a. has dtype - int64 
            can be converted to smaller dtype

2. p class : (categorical)
    a. has dtype - int64 
            can be converted to category dtype
    b. majority people in 3rd class

3. sex : (categorical)
    a. has dtype - object 
            can be converted to category dtype

4. age: (categorical / numerical)
    a. has dtype - float64 
            can be converted to smaller dtype 
    b. has nan values
    c. 75% is 38 but max is 80
    d. 714/891 non-null


5. embarked : (categorical)
    a. has dtype - object
            can be converted to category dtype
    b. has nan values
    c. 889/891 non-null

6. cabin: (mixed)
    a. has many nan values
    b. 204 non-null
    c. has multiple cabin names in one - diff alloted for family members

7. fare : (numerical)
    a. potential outliers as avg is 32, max 512

8. survived : (categorical)
    a. has int64 dtype
        can be converted to categorical
       

Test.csv : 418 entries, 11 columns
Everything same as above, but 

1. fare : (numerical)
    a. has one nan value
    b. potential outliers as avg is 32, max 512

### completness issue in cols:-

1. age - 177 null
2. fare - 1 null
3. cabin - 687 out of 891 null
4. embarked - 2 null

### accuracy issues in cols :-

1. age - float values
2. fare - has 0 as entry
3. name - disorder 


### feature engineering:-

cols that can be added: 

    1. No. of family members - from sibsp and parch , Both can be merged into one col .
    2. marital status - from title in name
    3. age group - children, teenagers , adults, old
    4. family size - individual , small , medium , large
