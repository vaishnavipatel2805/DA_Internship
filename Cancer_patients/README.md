# 🏥 Cancer Patients Data Analysis (2014–2024)

This project analyzes cancer patient records collected from **Kaggle**, covering  
the years **2014–2024**. The dataset includes **risk factors, survival years, treatment costs,  
cancer type & stage**, useful for healthcare analytics and predictive modeling.

### 📊 EDA Performed

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Distribution of cancer types by region/year  
- Risk factors correlation study  
- Stage vs Survival relationships  
- Cost variation across cancer types  
- Summary statistics and outlier detection  

---

### 📈 Visualization Ideas

- Heatmap for correlation  
- Cancer type & stage distribution graphs  
- Cost vs Survival scatter plots  
- Country-wise survival comparison  
- Risk factor vs severity plots  

---

### 🧠 Insight Examples

- Higher genetic risk correlates with advanced stages  
- Countries with lower pollution show better survival years  
- Treatment cost significantly varies across cancer types  
- Smoking & alcohol score influence overall severity
