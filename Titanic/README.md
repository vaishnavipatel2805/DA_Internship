# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis – EDA Project

This folder contains complete Exploratory Data Analysis of the **Titanic Passenger Dataset**.  
The dataset is widely used for data analytics and machine learning classification problems.  
Objective is to understand **patterns affecting passenger survival**.

|--------|-------------|
| PassengerId | Unique passenger ID |
| Survived | 0 = No, 1 = Yes (Target) |
| Pclass | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) |
| Name | Passenger name with title |
| Sex | Gender |
| Age | Age in years |
| SibSp | Siblings/spouses aboard |
| Parch | Parents/children aboard |
| Ticket | Ticket number |
| Fare | Ticket fare |
| Cabin | Cabin number (many missing) |
| Embarked | Port of embarkation (C/Q/S) |

### 📊 EDA Covered

- Missing value analysis
- Univariate, bivariate & miltivariate analysis
- Class vs survival rate
- Gender-wise survival probability
- Fare & Age distribution
- Correlation heatmap

---

### 📈 Key Visualizations

- Survival count plot
- Sex vs Survival bar plot
- Pclass survival comparison
- Age & Fare distribution plots
- Heatmap for feature correlation

---

### 🧠 Insights (Example)

- Females had significantly higher survival rate than males  
- 1st class passengers survived more than 3rd class  
- Children had better survival chances  
- Higher fare = More survival probability  

---

### 🔥 Future Scope

- Build ML model to predict survival  
- Feature engineering (Title, Family Size, Age Bin)  
- Interactive dashboard visualization
