TITANIC DATASET – COMPLETE ANALYSIS & INSIGHTS
===============================================

1. DATA READING – FINDINGS
---------------------------
• The dataset contains passenger information such as Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked, Cabin, Ticket.
• Missing values found mainly in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
• Cabin column is highly sparse (~77% missing).
• Age column contains moderate missing values (~19%).
• Fare contains some extreme values (outliers).
• Dataset is a mix of numerical and categorical features.

### Handling Missing Values & Outliers

Age was imputed using random many 
Age grp with mode.  
Cabin converted to Deck and missing values treated as ‘Unknown’
Fare outliers detected using IQR method & capped to upper limit
filled fare with median

2. FEATURE ENGINEERING
----------------------

A. FAMILY SIZE

• Created using (SibSp + Parch + 1).
• FamilySize ranges from 1 to 11.
• Majority of passengers traveled alone (FamilySize = 1).
• Family size strongly impacts survival.

B. FAMILY TYPE

• Categorized as:
    - Alone (1)
    - Small Family (2–4)
    - Large Family (>=5)
• Alone passengers have lowest survival.

C. TITLE EXTRACTION

• Extracted from Name column: Mr, Miss, Mrs, Master, etc.
• Rare titles grouped to reduce sparsity.
• Titles reflect age, gender, and social class → affect survival drastically.

D. DECK (CABIN LETTER)

• Extracted first letter of Cabin.
• Missing cabins assigned 'Unknown'.
• Higher decks (A, B, C) correspond to higher-class passengers → higher survival.

E. INDIVIDUAL FARE

• Calculated by dividing total Fare by FamilySize.
• Normalizes shared-ticket fares.
• Useful for fair comparison among passengers.

F. AGE GROUP

• Binned Age into groups: Baby, Child, Young Adult, Middle Aged Adult, Senior.
• Younger groups show higher survival rates.

3. DATA ANALYSIS
----------------

A. UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS – INSIGHTS
--------------------------------

• Survived:
  - ~38% survived, 62% did not.
  - Imbalanced but workable distribution.

• Pclass:
  - Most passengers belonged to 3rd class.
  - Indicates affordability trends.

• Sex:
  - More males than females.
  - Important for survival analysis due to “women and children first”.

• Age:
  - Right-skewed distribution.
  - Most passengers aged 20–40.

• Fare:
  - Highly skewed with large outliers.
  - Indicates diverse economic backgrounds.

• Embarked:
  - Majority boarded from Southampton (S).
  - Cherbourg (C) has fewer but richer passengers.

• FamilySize:
  - Most passengers traveled alone.
  - Very large families are rare.

• Title:
  - Majority are Mr, Miss, Mrs.
  - Rare titles represent elite passengers.

• Deck:
  - Majority are 'Unknown'.
  - Among known: B, C are most common.

• AgeGroup:
  - Young Adults dominate.
  - Few babies and seniors.

B. BIVARIATE ANALYSIS
---------------------

I. CATEGORICAL–CATEGORICAL

A. Survived vs All Categories

• Survived vs Sex:
  - Females survival ~74%, males ~19%.

• Survived vs Pclass:
  - 1st class survival highest, 3rd class lowest.

• Survived vs Embarked:
  - C > Q > S in survival rate.

• Survived vs AgeGroup:
  - Babies and children show highest survival.

• Survived vs FamilyType:
  - Small families survive more; Alone lowest survival.

• Survived vs Deck:
  - Higher decks (A–C) survive more.

B. Pclass vs All Categories

• Pclass vs Sex:
  - 3rd class has more males.

• Pclass vs Embarked:
  - S has most 3rd class passengers.

• Pclass vs AgeGroup:
  - Young Adults dominate all classes.

• Pclass vs FamilyType:
  - Larger families mostly in 3rd class.

C. Sex vs Selected Categorical Columns

• Sex vs Embarked:
  - Nearly balanced except Q (more females).

• Sex vs AgeGroup:
  - Slightly more males in all age groups except babies.

• Sex vs Survived:
  - Gender impacts survival strongest among all features.

II. CATEGORICAL–NUMERICAL

A. Age with all Categorical Columns

• Age vs Survived:
  - Children have higher survival.

• Age vs Pclass:
  - 1st class passengers older on average.

• Age vs Sex:
  - Females slightly younger distribution.

• Age vs Embarked:
  - C passengers slightly older.

B. Fare with all Categorical Columns

• Fare vs Survived:
  - Survived passengers paid higher fare.

• Fare vs Pclass:
  - 1st class: highest fare, 3rd class: lowest.

• Fare vs Sex:
  - Females generally paid higher fare.

• Fare vs Embarked:
  - C passengers paid the highest fares.

C. Individual Fare with all Columns

• IndividualFare vs Survived:
  - Higher per-person fare increases survival.

• IndividualFare vs Pclass:
  - Strong separation by class.

III. NUMERICAL–NUMERICAL

• Fare vs Age:
  - No strong linear relation.

• Fare vs IndividualFare:
  - Highly correlated (expected).

• Age vs IndividualFare:
  - Weak relationship.

C. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
------------------------

1. Pclass + Sex + Survived

• Female survival high across all classes.
• Male survival extremely low in 3rd class.
• Strong combined effect of class and gender.

2. Age + Pclass + Survived

• Younger 1st class passengers survive most.
• Older 3rd class passengers have lowest survival.

3. Survived + Deck + Pclass

• Deck A, B, C (upper decks) show highest survival.
• Lower decks (E, F, G) correspond to lower class → lower survival.

4. Fare + Pclass + Survived

• Higher fare → higher class → higher survival.
• High-fare 3rd class passengers still have worse survival due to location.

5. FamilySize + Pclass + Survived

• Small families (2–4) in 1st/2nd class survive the most.
• Large families (>5) in 3rd class survive the least.

6. Age + Sex + Survived

• Age influences survival, but Sex is the dominant deciding factor.
• Survival pattern: Female > Children > Male Adults > Elderly Males

7. Embarked + Pclass + Survived

• Survival pattern across (Port × Class)

C + 1st class → Best survival

Q + 3rd class → Worst survival

S + 3rd class → Low survival due to crowding + male majority

• Survival differences across Embarked ports are mainly due to the distribution of travel classes at each port, not the port itself.

8. Age + Fare + Survived

> Survival increases with higher fare and younger age.
> Fare indirectly captures economic class, which heavily influenced survival chances during evacuation.

----------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------
• Survival strongly influenced by Sex and Pclass.
• Higher fare, better deck, and elite titles improve survival chances.
• Family size and age also contribute but less strongly.
• Outliers in Fare distort distribution and need capping.
• Multivariate patterns confirm that socio-economic status had major influence on survival.
• The engineered features (Title, Deck, FamilyType, IndividualFare, AgeGroup) significantly enhanced insights.
